  - pathName: Ichor Explanation
    paragraphs:
    - Some crops require a special nutrient known as Ichor. Unlike the other nutrients,
      plants do not produce it, nor have I found a way to condense it into a fertilizer.
    - I have traced high concentrations of Ichor in living creatures... Perhaps if
      I could get a sample...

  - pathName: StalkSeeds
    paragraphs:
    - With how fast these grow, I would personally classify them as a weed.

      no time.
