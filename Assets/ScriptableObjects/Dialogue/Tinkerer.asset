    - Oh hey! So you are the new one around here.
    - I love puting gears in a box and hearing it purr!!!
    - Come check out my shop when you can! It'll probably help you defend that farm
      of yours.

  - pathName: Ichor Explanation
    paragraphs:
    - Some crops require a special nutrient known as Ichor. Unlike the other nutrients,
      plants do not produce it, nor have I found a way to condense it into a fertilizer.
    - I have traced high concentrations of Ichor in living creatures... Perhaps if
      I could get a sample...

  - pathName: Seed Explanation
    paragraphs:
    - There are many plants that have special properties to them.

      them!

  - pathName: Nutrient Explanation
    paragraphs:
    - Have you been mixing up where you plant your seeds?
    - It helps to rotate your crops to better suite your soil and keep the nutrients
      high.
    - Or if that is too much of an ask, you can just use my fertalizer!
    - I highly recommend the second option.
