      good levels of Gloamphage in your soil you are set!

  - pathName: StalkSeeds
    paragraphs:
    - With how fast these grow, I would personally classify them as a weed.
    - Keep an eye on their water intake and you will have a field of Gloomstalk in
      no time.

  - pathName: GingerSeeds
    paragraphs:
    - Personally, I could never get these to grow. This plant is very picky regarding
      its growing conditions, and requires constant maintenance.
    - However, there is merit in a succesful yield. With how rare these roots are,
      they fetch a high price.
