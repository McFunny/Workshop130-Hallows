  - pathName: Ichor Explanation
    paragraphs:
    - Some crops require a special nutrient known as Ichor. Unlike the other nutrients,
      plants do not produce it, nor have I found a way to condense it into a fertilizer.
    - I have traced high concentrations of Ichor in living creatures... Perhaps if
      I could get a sample...

  - pathName: Seed Explanation
    paragraphs:

      them!

  - pathName: Nutrient Explanation
    paragraphs:
    - Have you been mixing up where you plant your seeds?
    - It helps to rotate your crops to better suite your soil and keep the nutrients
      high.
    - Or if that is too much of an ask, you can just use my fertalizer!
    - I highly recommend the second option.

      it.

  - pathName: Fertilizer
    paragraphs:
    - That stuff is real handy for when you have a plot of land that just can't support
      life no more.
    - One bag will fill up any tile of ground with its specified nutrient.

  - pathName: CarrotSeeds
    paragraphs:
    - Pale carrots are a very well rounded crop. Not too picky, as long as you have
      good levels of Gloamphage in your soil you are set!
    emotions: 00000000
  - pathName: TuberSeeds
    paragraphs:
    - TerraTubers are very easy to care for, and can tolerate very rough conditions
      longer than other plants
    - Just be sure to keep them away from any sources of that nasty blight!

  - pathName: DrakeSeeds
    paragraphs:
    - Mandrakes are a nasty bunch. They aren't harmful, but they are such a pain
      to chase down!
    - Makes me thankful none of the other plants here fight back...

  - pathName: StalkSeeds
    paragraphs:
    - With how fast these grow, I would personally classify them as a weed.
    - Keep an eye on their water intake and you will have a field of Gloomstalk in
      no time.

  - pathName: BeanSeeds
    paragraphs:
    - Unlike most plants, BloodBeans continue to grow after harvest if left in the
      soil.
    - Keep its ichor levels steady to ensure multiple yields.
    emotions: 0000000000000000
  - pathName: GingerSeeds
    paragraphs:
    - Personally, I could never get these to grow. This plant is very picky regarding
      its growing conditions, and requires constant maintenance.
    - However, there is merit in a succesful yield. With how rare these roots are,
      they fetch a high price.
