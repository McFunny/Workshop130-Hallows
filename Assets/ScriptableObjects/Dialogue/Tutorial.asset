    - You are finally awake. {freezePlayer}
    - ...
    - ...You VeilWood residents always seem to have your memory fail you, so let
      me remind you how things work here.
    - You are now responsible for providing this hamlet sustenance through the crops
      you cultivate here.
    - Anything you grow, you bring to me. In return, I will give you <color=#E0D38F>Mints</color>
      <sprite index=0> to spend on whatever baubles or artifacts you desire.
    - You will need to start somewhere. Here, take these seeds. Use your hoe to cultivate
      some new life. {giveGift}
    - The seeds grown here are special. Only under the gaze of twilight will they
      rampantly grow, and you must pay extra mind none of the wildlife makes a meal
      out of them.
    - Your new role is an important one....
    - ...
    - Do not disappoint.
