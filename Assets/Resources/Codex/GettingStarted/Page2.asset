  leftDescription: The mist has caused all manners of mutations of the world, and
    the flora is no exception. Here, crops lie dormant in the sun. Once under the
    glow of the moon, when the mist stirs most violently, do they begin to grow.
  description: It is important to keep the crops well watered and their nutrient
    levels high. Each crop consumes and produces different nutrients at diferent
    rates. Plan your harvest accordingly.
