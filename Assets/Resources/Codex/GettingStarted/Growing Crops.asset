  description:
  - Crops will only grow during the night. Each crop takes varying hours to advance
    1 stage of growth.
  - In order to advance their growth, the plant must have their Water and Nutritional
    needs met. Otherwise, they will take stress damage. Too much stress and the plant
    will wither, providing no harvest.
