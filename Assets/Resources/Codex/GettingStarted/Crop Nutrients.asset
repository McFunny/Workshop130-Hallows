  description:
  - 'Nutrients are seperated into 3 types: Gloamphage, Terrazyme, and Ichor. Each
    plant consumes and produces different nutrients, and these nutrients are required
    for growth.'
  - A tile lacking in nutrients can be restored by either planting a crop that produces
    the desired nutrient, or purchasing fertilizer and applying it to the tile directly.
  - Ichor is a unique nutrient, in that no plant can produce it. The main way to
    restore Ichor to a tile is by defeating a creature nearby the tile. Larger creatures
    produce more Ichor.
